## Model-based architecture-yml-jdl

## How to use this project

This is an eclipse emf project that has several components grouped in different branches. The first part in the master branch contains the code for the meta-models, the second part in the eclipse-runtime branch contains an example of models based on the two previously defined meta-models, while the last part in the xtext branch contains the code for the xtext implementation based on the two meta-model .ecore files. That said, to use the code, you need to clone all three branches and reconfigure the paths to these projects after opening the master branch project in eclipse.
